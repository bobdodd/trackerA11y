# TrackerA11y - Comprehensive Accessibility Testing Platform

## Project Overview

TrackerA11y is a unified accessibility testing platform that combines real-time interaction tracking, screen structure analysis, and integrated diarized audio processing to provide the most comprehensive view of user experience during accessibility testing. By implementing a hybrid TypeScript-Python architecture, TrackerA11y becomes the definitive tool for understanding both what users do and what they think during accessibility testing sessions.

## Project Vision

TrackerA11y represents a paradigm shift from fragmented accessibility testing tools to a unified platform that provides unprecedented insight into user experience. Unlike existing solutions that require complex tool integration and post-hoc correlation, TrackerA11y captures and correlates all aspects of user interaction in real-time with microsecond precision.
